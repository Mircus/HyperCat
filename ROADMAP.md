# 🐱 HyperCat ROADMAP

Welcome to the official roadmap of **HyperCat** — an ambitious open-source library for **computational category theory**. As academic interest grows, our goal is to evolve HyperCat into a *mature toolkit* for category theorists, logicians, and theoretical computer scientists.

> “Think diagrammatically. Reason algebraically. Build categorically.”

---

## 📍 Current Version
**v0.1** — Basic category definitions, morphisms, graph-theoretic diagrams.

---

## 🔺 Stage 1: Foundational Enhancements (v0.2)

### ✅ Commutative Diagram Checker
- Verify if diagrams commute by checking all paths between any two objects.
- Internally represent diagrams as directed multigraphs with labeled morphisms.
- Core functionality for validating constructions and debugging.

### ✅ (Co)Limits and Cones
- Define abstract `Limit`, `Colimit`, `Cone`, `Cocone`.
- Support interactive pullbacks, pushouts, products, and coproducts.
- (In future) Check universal properties algorithmically.

### ✅ Functor Consistency
- Validate that a user-defined functor preserves identity and composition.
- Automatically suggest corrections or counterexamples.

## 🔷 Stage 2: Expressivity Expansion

### 🔁 Natural Transformations and 2-Category Tools
- Encode and visualize naturality squares.
- Support for string diagrams and higher-dimensional morphisms.

### 💾 Export to LaTeX
- Translate diagrams into TikZ / Xy-pic code.
- Crucial for research papers and academic presentations.

### 🌐 Category Library
- Preload categories: **Set**, **FinSet**, **Grp**, **Top**, **Vect**.
- Quick instantiation for common examples and benchmarks.

---

## 🔶 Stage 3: Semantic Power & Interactivity

### 📐 Internal Logic and Elementary Topoi
- Encode internal logic of categories (e.g. subobject classifier).
- Future support for internal languages (predicate logic, HoTT).

### 🔄 Homotopy-Theoretic Extensions
- Visual tagging for commutativity up to homotopy.
- Support for simplicial categories and higher homotopies.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Category Assistant
- Natural language interface: “What is the colimit of this diagram?”
- Uses GPT/LangChain to guide users through constructions.

---

## 💡 Bonus Features

- **Diagram Generator** — auto-generate spans, zigzags, cubes, etc.
- **Proof Explorer** — step-by-step morphism composition with graphical feedback.
- **Equational Rewriting** — string diagram simplification and algebraic normalization.
