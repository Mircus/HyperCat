# 🤝 Contributing to HyperCat

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to **HyperCat** — a project at the frontier of **computational category theory**.

We believe mathematics should be **executable**, **collaborative**, and **beautiful** — and you can help make that happen.

---

## 📐 What Is HyperCat?

HyperCat is a library for:
- Building and analyzing **commutative diagrams**
- Computing **(co)limits**, **natural transformations**, and **adjunctions**
- Exploring the **semantics** of categories through code
- Bridging symbolic logic and diagrammatic reasoning

If that excites you, you're in the right place.

## 🧱 How to Contribute

### 🔧 1. Code Contributions

We welcome:
- New modules: `limits`, `functors`, `transformations`, `visualization`, etc.
- Extensions to the diagram-checker (e.g., path simplification, morphism rewriting)
- Bug fixes and code refactoring
- Jupyter notebooks with examples or theory demos

Before submitting:
- Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- Write clear docstrings and inline comments
- Include minimal unit tests for new features (we use `pytest`)

```bash
# To run tests:
pytest tests/
