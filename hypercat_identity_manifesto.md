# HyperCat: Which Parts of Higher Categories and Why

## Core Insight
**Identity is too strict.**  
In real systems (data modeling, AI, knowledge graphs), objects that are "different" under strict identity are often *the same up to structure or deformation*.  
Higher categories and Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) provide the formal machinery to replace rigid identity with **weak equivalence**.

## What to Include

### (∞,1)-Category Core
- **Objects, morphisms, mapping spaces**
- **Homotopy (co)limits**: pullbacks, pushouts, products, equalizers
- **Homotopy Kan extensions**: schema migrations, ETL, task transfer
- **Adjunctions up to homotopy**: lossy vs lossless transforms
- **Monoidal structure**: combining datasets or pipelines
- **Path and loop objects**: versioning, diffs, reversible edits
- **Factorization systems**: validation/sanitization as morphism classes

### HoTT Elements (Operational)
- **Equivalences (≃)** as first-class: schemas/models identified if equivalent
- **Univalence (operational rewrite)**: equivalences = equalities in practice
- **Higher Inductive Types (minimal)**: pushouts, quotients, truncations
- **Modalities (□,◇)**: closed-world vs open-world data; verified vs possible
- **Path types**: provenance of data/model transformations

## Why This Matters

### For Data Modelers
- **Schema evolution**: treat renamed/reshaped schemas as equivalent
- **Deduplication**: weak equivalence handles “John Smith” vs “J. Smith”
- **Merges**: pushouts guarantee semantic coherence
- **Provenance**: paths record *how* one dataset became another
- **Uncertainty**: truncations and modalities encode partial or anonymized data

### For AI / Neural Network Designers
- **Training runs**: checkpoints connected by homotopy (paths)
- **Fine-tuning**: deformation from base model = path object
- **Reparametrization**: permutations/scalings = weak equivalences
- **Embeddings**: spaces equivalent up to rotation
- **Distillation / transfer learning**: weakly equivalent models up to approximation

## Essence
- **Strict identity builds walls.**  
  (`A ≠ B` unless literally the same bits)  

- **Homotopy identity builds bridges.**  
  (`A ≃ B` if connected by structure-preserving path)  

HyperCat adopts this second principle, making data models and AI systems **resilient to change, structurally robust, and provenance-aware**.
